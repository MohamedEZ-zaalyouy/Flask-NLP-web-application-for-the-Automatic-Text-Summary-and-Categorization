<h1>Introduction</h1>
Summarization is the task of condensing a piece of text to a shorter version, reducing the size of the initial text while at the same time preserving key informational elements and the meaning of content. Since manual text summarization is a time expensive and generally laborious task, the automatization of the task is gaining increasing popularity and therefore constitutes a strong motivation for academic research. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).


<h1>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>
Natural Language Processing is the technology used to aid computers to understand the human’s natural language. It’s not an easy task teaching machines to understand how we communicate. Natural Language Processing which usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.
